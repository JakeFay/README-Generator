## Description

This application generates a professional README.md file. Often times the README.md file is overlooked. With the help of this application you won't have to worry about that again! The user promps will help guide you to enter key information about your project and organize it properly.

I created this application to help make a more professional README.md file for my projects. Before this i was confused about what information to enter in a README.md and where to put it.
